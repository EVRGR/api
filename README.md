Evergreen API
===


This is the full, public version of the Evergreen API, accessible through any servers running through the Evergreen protocol. 

This allows any web application or mobile application to have an Evergreen wallet associated with their service. 

As part of the core Evergreen services, we offer free, instant payment within your e-commerce platform and with any other participants in the Evergreen network. 

It is the same API that powers our mobile applications, as demoed on our website (www.evr.gr) and available in the app store (http://bit.ly/evergreenapp)

It contains a protocol for:

	(1) User identification, including using third party services like facebook for authentication

	(2) Transactions

	(3) Merchant listing of services

The public version of the protocol does not include the purchase of credits. Please contact us at info@evr.gr if you need any additional service that may be part of the private API.
